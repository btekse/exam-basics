# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up


# Tasks
## 1-3. Complete the following tasks: (~90 mins)
- [Odd Average](oddavg/OddAvg.java)
- [Copy](copy/Copy.java)
- [BlackJack](blackjack/BlackJack.java)

### Acceptance criteria
The application is accepted if:
- The solution works according to specification [1p each]
- The solution follows [styleguide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/styleguide/java.md) [1p]
- Has proper error handling where the specification says it [1p each]
- Has the correct loops, methods, filters [1p each]
- The code is clean, without unnecessary repetition, and with descriptive names [1p each]
- You commit frequently with descriptive commit messages [1p]

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

#### Your answer:
[add your answer here]   
1:  method (collections of statements), "public static" is the modifier
2:  (primitive) data type of the method
3:  recursive harmonic method 
4: int means (integer), this will be the type of 'n' variable --> together formal parameter
5: n variable --> part of formal parameter
6: define the type of "sum": double
7: for loop: it increase the value of "i" variable in each loop 'til it's reach the value of "n"; and add the value of "sum" by 1.0/i
8: the return value of the for loop in the "sum" variable

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer: In each class there is at least 1 constructor. It can initializes the new object(s). This have to be named after the class. Constructor is not a method. We can call it with "new" wich will be give back the object(s).
